# Classic form, but client can add new lines

## if he want to add new link (or other info)

I mad this form for "buyer". He needs than client can add one or more shops links and add size, color and article.

This form is construct by free "phpmailer" and have "prePHPMailer.js" file, where I did:

- adding new lines
- some checking required lines
- getting all "text" lines and construct one row in last "text" line with fixed and dynamic text (number of row, "Color", "Size", "Article")

I know, that it can did it better, but my client wanted do it faster and did't want pay a lot for this form. Maybe anytime I will can optimize it.
